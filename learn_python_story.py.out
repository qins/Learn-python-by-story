Alice: What is the sum of 1 to 100? The answer is 5050 which calculate by the most stupid but simple coding method.

King: Alice, You are so clever, my sweet heart. 
I have $10. And $2 can buy 1 bottle of beer.
4 bottle caps can be exchanged for 1 bottle beer.
2 empty bottles can be exchanged for 1 bottle of beer.
So, how many bottles of beer can I drink?
I will make you the next Queen if you give the correct answer.

You can drink 15 bottles, dady.
Sorry, darling, but I can only drink 2 bottles atmost.
